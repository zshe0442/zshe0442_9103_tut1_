## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
- The imaging technique I would like to refer to is inspired by the use of some common household items, including thumbtacks, bottle caps and other waste materials to re-use collages to form striking decorative art works.

- I want to combine colored round squares, as shown in the example, into various figure paintings.  This technique enhances the artistic representation of an image by abstracting shapes and creating visually engaging pieces.  This method can help us to grasp the essence of the color of the selected art in the major project, and show the gorgeousness of its color.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
- In this code it uses Python's Pillow library to process the image, enhance the contrast, and extract the RGB values to help me achieve the desired effect. I can map ASCII characters to colored circles (SVG<circle> elements) by modifying the output format and replacing the ASCII character drawing with SVG circles of different sizes and colors.
